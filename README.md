# Nearest Neighbour Analysis with Geospatial data

## Guide on how to find the nearest neighbour of places in Python


Finding the nearest neighbour of an object to another is a common spatial data analysis task. For example, determining the closest service point to your home is an optimisation problem that requires performing Nearest Neighbour Analysis with spatial data.

In this tutorial, we perform Nearest Neighbourhood Analysis with Bike Sharing dataset from Chicago City. The dataset consists of two separate files. The first one is bike stations and the second is randomly generated points. We want to determine which station is near to any given point in the second dataset - the randomly generated points.
